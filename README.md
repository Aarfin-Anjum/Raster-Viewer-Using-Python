# Raster-Viewer-Using-Python
Using Rasterio, Geopandas, and NumPy, this is a basic shapefile analyzer and raster viewer. It can display raster data, plot shapefile attribute data, dynamically change band combinations, and work with arrays. Use of these features is demonstrated by loading a raster image and matching shapefile for analysis and visualisation.
